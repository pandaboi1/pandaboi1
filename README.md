# 👋 My name is **Edwin Serna**, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; also known as  **Eden** or [@pandaboi1](https://github.com/pandaboi1).

## 🎮 My Interests

I am passionate about ***software development*** and ***video games***. Growing up, I was always curious about how things worked, especially computers and the inner workings of software. As I discovered that most technology is written with coding languages, I gained an interest in learning how to create my own scripts to accomplish personal projects for myself and others. Video games were a significant part of my childhood, and it is fascinating that they are essentially large groups of code that create immersive experiences for any player, even if they have little to no technical abilities. ***I will*** learn how to create programs that can make a ***difference***, provide ***unique experiences***, and hopefully ***make life a little easier*** for people.

## 🌱 Current Learning Journey

I am currently focused on learning how to design, build, and deploy websites. My current projects include:

- Learning Javascript, CSS, and HTML through hands-on projects.
- Enhancing my understanding of algorithms and data structures.
- Updating old projects that were not finished.

## 🤝 Collaboration Opportunities

I am open to collaborating on personal projects, including:

- An automated cat feeder:
  - Programmed using an Arduino Uno.
  - Scheduled feeding times and quantities.
  - Audible alerts when food is ready.
  - Smart features to monitor food levels and adjust dispensing times.

- Creating my own website:
  - Developing an e-commerce platform for marketing and selling project-based products online.
  - Storing all my projects (Free and Paid versions).
  - Implementing a chat system for providing project feedback, direct messaging, project requests, and commissioning services.
