# 👋 Hey, I am Edwin Serna, also known as @pandaboi1 or Eden.

## 🎮 My Interests

I am passionate about software development and video games. Growing up, I was always curious about how things worked, especially computers and the inner workings of video games. As I discovered that most technology is written with code, I became interested in learning how to create my own scripts to benefit myself and others. Video games were a significant part of my childhood, and I find it fascinating that they are essentially large groups of code that create immersive experiences for players of all technical abilities. I am motivated to learn how to create programs that can make a difference, provide unique experiences, and hopefully make life a little easier for people.

## 🌱 Current Learning Journey

I am currently focused on learning how to design, build, and deploy websites. My current projects include:

- Learning Javascript, CSS, and HTML through hands-on projects.
- Enhancing my understanding of algorithms and data structures.
- Updating old projects that were not finished.

## 🤝 Collaboration Opportunities

I am open to collaborating on personal projects, including:

- An automated cat feeder:
  - Programmed using an Arduino Uno.
  - Scheduled feeding times and quantities.
  - Audible alerts when food is ready.
  - Smart features to monitor food levels and adjust dispensing times.

- Creating my own website:
  - Developing an e-commerce platform for marketing and selling project-based products online.
  - Storing all my projects (Free and Paid versions).
  - Implementing a chat system for providing project feedback, direct messaging, project requests, and commissioning services.
